Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
==============================

This repository provides R scripts to generate tidy data from [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The data for this project can be downloaded below:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The above file should be downloaded and unzipped in the same directory as the `run_analysis.R` script. The script expects the `UCI HAR Dataset` directory to be in the same directory.

The script depends on the [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) R library and should be installed prior to running the `run_analysis.R` script.
